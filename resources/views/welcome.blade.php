                    We want every visitor to feel right at home in our practice. Our friendly and experienced team are
                    on hand to greet you and offer you a tea or coffee in our modern reception area so you can sit back
                    and relax before being seen. If you have any other requests or questions while you wait, we will be
                    only too happy to help!

                <h5>Providing Clinical Excellence</h5>

                    We take your experience of being treated by us very seriously. We pride ourselves in offering the
                    highest standards of treatment that are both safe, effective, confidential and evidence-based. To

                    latest developments in pediatric medicine.
                </p>

                <h5>Comprehensive Care</h5>
                <p class="text-muted">
                    Our highly qualified and experienced team are able to deliver exceptional care for all manner of
                    foot,
                    ankle and lower limb conditions ranging from sports injuries to corn removal to nail surgery to
                    running analysis and the list goes on! All of our treatments are delivered with the same attention
                    to detail in our brand-new clinic fitted with state-of- art equipment.

                <h5>Empowering Others</h5>
                <p class="text-muted">
                    We are real believers in sharing our knowledge and expertise for two important reasons; to help our
                    patients by equipping them with better understanding of the nature of their problem, and to grow a
                    network a like-minded professionals in the Scottish Borders seeking to achieve better outcomes for
                    their patients/clients. Part of our commitment to this involves providing several training sessions
                    throughout the year on various lower limb topics to our fellow podiatrists and other colleagues.
                </p>

                <h5>Always Listening</h5>
                <p class="text-muted">
                    We see all manner of foot, ankle and lower limb problems in our clinics but what is far more varied
                    are the people who we have the privilege to meet. Everyone has a unique story to tell and we want
                    to hear it. We know that every individualâ€™s beliefs, experiences and expectations can and should
                    guide the way we look at their problem. That is why we strive to listen closely, to put you at the
                    centre of the picture and work with you to make your experience with us personal and exceptional.
